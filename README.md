# Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Diagnostic Strategies for GAS Pharyngitis

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project evaluates the cost-effectiveness of two diagnostic strategies for **Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis**:
1. **Standard of Care (Throat Culture)**
2. **Alternative Strategy (Rapid Antigen Detection Test - RADT)**

We use **microsimulation modeling** to estimate **costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs)**. 
The results are summarized through plots, tables, and a structured report.
