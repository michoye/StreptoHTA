# Is Throat Culture More Cost-Effective than Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Testing (RADT) for Diagnosisng Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in Pedriatric Sore Throat Patients?

In this exercise, we will model Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis using an individual-based state-transition model, commonly referred to as a microsimulation model. This model will simulate the progression of patients experiencing sore throat symptoms, incorporating two diagnostic strategies: Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) and Throat Culture (TC).

```

# 04 Sample individual level characteristics

## 04.1 Static characteristics

```{r}
# sample the treatment effect modifier at baseline
v_x     <- runif(n_i, min = 0.95, max = 1.05) 
# sample from the age distribution the initial age for every individual
v_age0  <- sample(x = dist_Age$age, prob = dist_Age$prop, size = n_i, replace = TRUE) 
```

## 04.2 Dynamic characteristics

Here, we specify the information regarding the initial health states of the individuals as well as in which health state each of the individuals start.

```{r}
v_M_init  <- rep("H", times = n_i)   # Specify the initial health state of the individuals 
v_n_cycles_s_init <- rep(0, n_i)  # everyone begins in the healthy state (in this example)
```

## 04.3 Create a dataframe with the individual characteristics

Now, we merge the static and dynamic individual characteristics into one dataframe.

We created 100000 patients between the age of 5-55 years of age who al start off healthy, with no history of being sick.

```{r}
# data frame with each individual's 
# ID number, treatment effect modifier, age and initial time in sick state and initial health state at the start of the simulation
df_X  <- data.frame(ID = 1:n_i, M_x = v_x, Age = v_age0, n_cycles = v_n_cycles_s_init, M_init = v_M_init)

head(df_X)  # print the first rows of the dataframe

# See also:
# Define the plot
p <- ggplot(df_X, aes(x = Age)) +
    geom_histogram()
# Save the plot as PNG
ggsave("figs/histogram_age.png", plot = p, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

## 05.1 Probability function

The `Probs` function updates the transition probabilities of every cycle. Important: (1) The probability from Healthy (H) to Sick (S) (`p_HS`) depends on the age. (2) The probability to die when you are healthy also depends on age (3) The probability from Sick to dead (`p_S1D`) depends on the number of cycles you have been in sick (`n_cycles_s`)

```{r}
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X, Diag = "SoC") { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t:  health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data 
    # Diag:  diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # transition probabilities for that cycle

# Diagnosis specific transition probabilities
  if (Diag == "SoC") {
    p_SH <- p_SH_SoC
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    p_SH <- p_SH_diagAB 
  }
   
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities
  m_p_t           <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_i)  
  # give the state names to the rows
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_names_states                               
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(x = df_X, y = p_mort, by = c("Age"))
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "H", "p_HD"]
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of becoming sick based on individual characteristics (Age)  
  p_HS_all <- inner_join(x = df_X, y = df_p_sick, by = c("Age"))
  p_HS     <- p_HS_all[M_t == "H", "p_HS"]
 
  # update m_p_t with the appropriate probabilities 
  # (all non-death probabilities are conditional on survival)
  # transition probabilities when Healthy 
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "H"] <- (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS)
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "H"] <- (1 - p_HD) * p_HS 
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "H"] <-      p_HD 
  
  
  # transition probabilities when Sick 
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "S"] <-  (1 - v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]) * p_SH
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "S"] <-  (1 - v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]) * (1 - p_SH)
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "S"] <-      v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]   
  

  # transition probabilities when Dead
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "D"] <- 0
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "D"] <- 0
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "D"] <- 1  
  
  return(t(m_p_t))
}       
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
Costs <- function (M_t, Diag = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # Diag:  diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # costs accrued in this cycle

    # Diagnosis specific costs
  if (Diag == "SoC") {
    c_diag <- c_diagSoC
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    c_diag <- c_diagAB
  } 
  
  c_t <- c()
  c_t[M_t == "H"] <- c_H  # costs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "S"] <- c_S + c_diag         # costs accrued by being sick this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "D"] <- c_D          # costs at dead state
  
  return(c_t)  # return costs accrued this cycle
}

```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t, cycle_length = 1, Diag = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # cl:  cycle length (default is 1)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data (TA added)
    # Diag:  Diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # QALYs accrued this cycle 

  u_t <- 0                          # by default the utility for everyone is zero
  u_t[M_t == "H"]    <- u_H         # update the utility if healthy
  
  if (Diag == "SoC") {  # update the utility if sick under standard of care
    u_t[M_t == "S"] <- u_S  
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    u_t[M_t == "S"] <- u_diagAB * df_X$x[M_t == "S"]  
  }
  
  u_t[M_t == "D"]    <- u_D         # update the utility if dead
  
  QALYs <- u_t * cycle_length  # calculate the QALYs during cycle t
  return(QALYs)      # return the QALYs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.4 The Microsimulation function

```{r}
MicroSim <- function(n_i, df_X, Diag = "SoC", seed = 1, cycle_length = 1, verbose ) {
  # Arguments:  
    # n_i: number of individuals
    # df_X: data frame with individual data 
    # Diag: diagnosis
    # seed: seed for the random number generator, default is 1
    # cycle_length: cycle length 
  # Returns:
    # results: data frame with total cost and QALYs
  
  set.seed(seed) # set a seed to be able to reproduce the same results
  
  # Here, we create three matrices called m_M, m_C and m_E
  # number of rows is equal to the n_i, the number of columns is equal to n_cycles 
  # (the initial state and all the n_cycles cycles)
  # m_M is used to store the health state information over time for every individual
  # m_C is used to store the costs information over time for every individual
  # m_E is used to store the effects information over time for every individual

  m_C[, 1] <- Costs(m_M[, 1])           # costs per individual during cycle 0
  m_E[, 1] <- Effs( m_M[, 1], cycle_length = cycle_length)   # QALYs per individual during cycle 0
  
  # open a loop for time running cycles 1 to n_cycles 
  for (t in 1:n_cycles) {
    print(t)
    # calculate the transition probabilities for the cycle based on health state t

    # check if transition probabilities are between 0 and 1

    # check if each of the rows of the transition probabilities matrix sum to one
    check_sum_of_transition_array(m_P, n_rows = n_i, n_cycles = n_cycles, verbose = TRUE)

    # update time since illness onset for t + 1 
    # NOTE: this code has a "reset of history" for time being sick
    # once someone is not "Sick" anymore, we reset n_cycles (set back to zero)

```

The first plot represents the distribution of total costs per person. The cost distribution is right-skewed, indicating that while most individuals accumulate costs in the \$3000-4000 range, some cases incur significantly higher costs.

The second plot illustrates the distribution of total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per individual. There is a strong peak around 4 QALYs, suggesting that most individuals maintain a relatively high quality of life and long survival.

The third graph tracks the proportion of individuals in each health state over 60 cycles (= 5 years). Initially, all individuals start in the Healthy (H) state, but over time, more transition into the Sick (S) state. The Sick state increases rapidly in the first few cycles before stabilizing and declining. Meanwhile, the proportion of deceased individuals (D) gradually but slowly rises, reflecting the low mortality rate for the disease. The total proportion correctly sums to 1 at each cycle.

plot_trace_microsim(outcomes_diagAB$m_M)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # Reset layout

```

The first plot represents the distribution of total costs per person. The distribution is right-skewed, with most costs accumulating in the range of \$4000-5000. Some individuals incur higher costs (\~\$6000 or more) due to extended illness duration, complications, or more intensive treatment.

The second plot illustrates the distribution of total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per individual. Most individuals accumulate around 4 QALYs, suggesting that they experience good quality of life and survive most of the simulation period. The right-skewed shape indicates that some individuals accumulate fewer QALYs due to prolonged sickness or early death.

The third plot tracks the proportion of individuals in each health state over time. Initially, a large fraction transitions into the sick (S) state, peaking around cycle 10. Over time, many recover (S â†’ H), but a subset remains chronically sick. The proportion of deceased individuals (D) gradually rises, reflecting normal mortality progression, while the healthy (H) population stabilizes.

Strategy AB costs \$697 more per person than Standard of Care but provides only a small QALY gain (0.05 QALYs).

The ICER of \$14,247 per QALY suggests that Strategy AB is cost-effective if the willingness-to-pay threshold is higher than this value. If the WTP is below \$14,247, Standard of Care remains the preferred option.

```{r}
## CEA frontier 
# Save as PNG
png("figs/cea_plot.png", width = 800, height = 600)
# Generate the plot
plot(df_cea, label = "all", txtsize = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.3))
# Close the graphical device
dev.off()

# Show the plot
plot(df_cea, label = "all", txtsize = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.3))
```

The efficient frontier confirms that Strategy AB is more effective but at a higher cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is \~\$14,247/QALY, meaning Strategy AB is cost-effective only if decision-makers are willing to pay at least this amount per QALY gained. The choice depends on the WTP thresholdâ€”if higher than \$14,247/QALY, Strategy AB is preferred, otherwise, SoC remains the cost-effective choice.

**Test model functions**

Two functions were defined in the 'Functions_StreptoHTA`.R'` file. The first was the `decision_model()` function which takes in model parameters and outputs the Microsiulation results. The second is the `calculate_ce_out()` function which calls `decision_model()` and uses the resulting Microsimulation results to compute the total costs, QALYs, returning a data frame of costs and QALYs.

```{r}
# Try the calculate_ce_out() function
df_ce <- calculate_ce_out(l_params_all)
df_ce

# Get strategies names (will be used to label plots)
v_names_str <- df_ce$Strategy
n_str <- length(v_names_str)
```
