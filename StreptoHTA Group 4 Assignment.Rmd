For this work we made use of the template developed by the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup: <http://darthworkgroup.com>.

The notation of our code is based on the following provided framework and coding convention: Alarid-Escudero, F., Krijkamp, E., Pechlivanoglou, P. et al. A Need for Change! A Coding Framework for Improving Transparency in Decision Modeling. PharmacoEconomics 37, 1329â€“1339 (2019). <https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00837-x>.

# Is Throat Culture More Cost-Effective than Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Testing (RADT) for Diagnosisng Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in Pedriatric Sore Throat Patients?

In this exercise, we will model Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis using an individual-based state-transition model, commonly referred to as a microsimulation model. This model will simulate the progression of patients experiencing sore throat symptoms, incorporating two diagnostic strategies: Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) and Throat Culture (TC).

# 02 Load functions

```{r}
# all needed functions are in the darthtools package
```

# 03 Model input

We load all the model input parameters as described in Table 1.

| **Test** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------:|
| RADT     | 0.9             |      0.78       |
| TC       | 0.94            |      0.97       |

We calculated the recovery rate the following way:

P(Recovery)=P(TP)+P(FN)+P(TN)+P(FP),

P(D) represents the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis, set to 0.1 for adults and 0.4 for children.

Since some patients die before recovering, we introduced a mortality risk for the sick state. Given that GAS pharyngitis has a very low fatality rate, a realistic survival probability would be nearly 1 over 30 years. However, for the purposes of this assignment, we artificially lowered the recovery rate to create a meaningful comparison.

For modeling purposes, we set a **fixed recovery rate of 0.12**, overriding the more realistic estimates.

### State rewards

## Calculate internal model parameters

```{r}
### Discount weight for costs and effects 
v_dwc   <- 1 / ((1 + (d_c * cycle_length)) ^ (0:n_cycles))
v_dwe   <- 1 / ((1 + (d_e * cycle_length)) ^ (0:n_cycles))

# Within-cycle correction (WCC) - method  options Simpson's 1/3 rule, "half-cycle" or "none" 
v_wcc    <- darthtools::gen_wcc(n_cycles = n_cycles, 
                                method = "Simpson1/3") # vector of wcc
```

# 04 Sample individual level characteristics

## 04.1 Static characteristics

```{r}
# sample the treatment effect modifier at baseline
v_x     <- runif(n_i, min = 0.95, max = 1.05) 
# sample from the age distribution the initial age for every individual
v_age0  <- sample(x = dist_Age$age, prob = dist_Age$prop, size = n_i, replace = TRUE) 

# See also:
ggplot(df_X, aes(x  = Age)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

## 04.2 Dynamic characteristics

Here, we specify the information regarding the initial health states of the individuals as well as in which health state each of the individuals start.

```{r}
v_M_init  <- rep("H", times = n_i)   # Specify the initial health state of the individuals 
v_n_cycles_s_init <- rep(0, n_i)  # everyone begins in the healthy state (in this example)
```

## 04.3 Create a dataframe with the individual characteristics

Now, we merge the static and dynamic individual characteristics into one dataframe.

We created 100000 patients between the age of 5-55 years of age who al start off healthy, with no history of being sick.

```{r}
# data frame with each individual's 
# ID number, treatment effect modifier, age and initial time in sick state and initial health state at the start of the simulation
df_X  <- data.frame(ID = 1:n_i, M_x = v_x, Age = v_age0, n_cycles = v_n_cycles_s_init, M_init = v_M_init)

head(df_X)  # print the first rows of the dataframe
```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

## 05.1 Probability function

The `Probs` function updates the transition probabilities of every cycle. Important: (1) The probability from Healthy (H) to Sick (S) (`p_HS`) depends on the age. (2) The probability to die when you are healthy also depends on age (3) The probability from Sick to dead (`p_S1D`) depends on the number of cycles you have been in sick (`n_cycles_s`)

```{r}
# Your turn
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X, Diag = "SoC") { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t:  health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data 
    # Diag:  diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # transition probabilities for that cycle

# Diagnosis specific transition probabilities
  if (Diag == "SoC") {
    p_SH <- p_SH_SoC
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    p_SH <- p_SH_diagAB 
  }
   
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities
  m_p_t           <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_i)  
  # give the state names to the rows
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_names_states                               
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(x = df_X, y = p_mort, by = c("Age"))
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "H", "p_HD"]
  
      # lookup baseline probability and rate of becoming sick based on individual characteristics (Age)  
  # p_HS_all <- inner_join(x = df_X, y = df_p_sick, by = c("Age"))
  # p_HS     <- p_HS_all[M_t == "H", "p_HS"]
 
  # update m_p_t with the appropriate probabilities 
  # (all non-death probabilities are conditional on survival)
  # transition probabilities when Healthy 
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "H"] <- (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS)
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "H"] <- (1 - p_HD) * p_HS 
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "H"] <-      p_HD 
  
  
  # transition probabilities when Sick 
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "S"] <-  (1 - v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]) * p_SH
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "S"] <-  (1 - v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]) * (1 - p_SH)
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "S"] <-      v_p_SD[df_X$n_cycles]   
  

  # transition probabilities when Dead
  m_p_t["H", M_t == "D"] <- 0
  m_p_t["S", M_t == "D"] <- 0
  m_p_t["D", M_t == "D"] <- 1  
  
  return(t(m_p_t))
}       
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
# Your turn
Costs <- function (M_t, Diag = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # Diag:  diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # costs accrued in this cycle

    # Diagnosis specific costs
  if (Diag == "SoC") {
    c_diag <- c_diagSoC
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    c_diag <- c_diagAB
  } 
  
  c_t <- c()
  c_t[M_t == "H"] <- c_H  # costs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "S"] <- c_S + c_diag         # costs accrued by being sick this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "D"] <- c_D          # costs at dead state
  
  return(c_t)  # return costs accrued this cycle
}

```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t, cycle_length = 1, Diag = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # cl:  cycle length (default is 1)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data (TA added)
    # Diag:  Diagnosis
  # Returns: 
    # QALYs accrued this cycle 

  u_t <- 0                          # by default the utility for everyone is zero
  u_t[M_t == "H"]    <- u_H         # update the utility if healthy
  
  if (Diag == "SoC") {  # update the utility if sick under standard of care
    u_t[M_t == "S"] <- u_S  
  } else if (Diag == "AB") {
    u_t[M_t == "S"] <- u_diagAB * df_X$x[M_t == "S"]  
  }
  
  u_t[M_t == "D"]    <- u_D         # update the utility if dead
  
  QALYs <- u_t * n_cycles  # calculate the QALYs during cycle t
  return(QALYs)      # return the QALYs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.4 The Microsimulation function

```{r}
MicroSim <- function(n_i, df_X, Diag = "SoC", seed = 1, cycle_length = 1, verbose ) {
  # Arguments:  
    # n_i: number of individuals
    # df_X: data frame with individual data 
    # Diag: diagnosis
    # seed: seed for the random number generator, default is 1
    # cycle_length: cycle length 
  # Returns:
    # results: data frame with total cost and QALYs
  
  set.seed(seed) # set a seed to be able to reproduce the same results
  
  # Here, we create three matrices called m_M, m_C and m_E
  # number of rows is equal to the n_i, the number of columns is equal to n_cycles 
  # (the initial state and all the n_cycles cycles)
  # m_M is used to store the health state information over time for every individual
  # m_C is used to store the costs information over time for every individual
  # m_E is used to store the effects information over time for every individual
  
  m_M <- m_C <- m_E <-  matrix(nrow = n_i, ncol = n_cycles + 1, 
                               dimnames = list(paste("ind"  , 1:n_i, sep = " "), 
                                               paste("cycle", 0:n_cycles, sep = " ")))  
 
  m_M[, 1] <- as.character(df_X$M_init) # initial health state at cycle 0 for individual i
  m_C[, 1] <- Costs(m_M[, 1])           # costs per individual during cycle 0
  m_E[, 1] <- Effs( m_M[, 1], cycle_length = cycle_length)   # QALYs per individual during cycle 0
  
  # open a loop for time running cycles 1 to n_cycles 
  for (t in 1:n_cycles) {
    print(t)
    # calculate the transition probabilities for the cycle based on health state t
    m_P <- Probs(m_M[, t], df_X, Diag = Diag)
    # check if transition probabilities are between 0 and 1
    check_transition_probability(m_P, verbose = TRUE)
    # check if each of the rows of the transition probabilities matrix sum to one
    check_sum_of_transition_array(m_P, n_rows = n_i, n_cycles = n_cycles, verbose = TRUE)
    
    # sample the next health state and store that state in matrix m_M
    m_M[, t + 1]  <- samplev(m_P, 1)    
    # calculate costs per individual during cycle t + 1
    m_C[, t + 1]  <- Costs(m_M[, t + 1], Diag = Diag)  
    # calculate QALYs per individual during cycle t + 1
    m_E[, t + 1]  <- Effs (m_M[, t + 1], cycle_length = cycle_length)  
    
    # update time since illness onset for t + 1 
    # NOTE: this code has a "reset of history" for time being sick
    # once someone is not "Sick" anymore, we reset n_cycles (set back to zero)
    # when you don't want a "reset" replace the last zero with the current value
    df_X$n_cycles <- if_else(m_M[, t + 1] == "S", df_X$n_cycles + 1, 0) 
    # update the age of individuals that are alive

      cat('\r', paste(t/n_cycles * 100, "% done", sep = " "))
    }
    
  } # close the loop for the time points 
  
  # Discounted total expected QALYs and Costs per strategy and apply cycle correction
  tc      <- m_C %*% (v_dwc * v_wcc)  # total (discounted and cycle corrected) cost per individual
  te      <- m_E %*% (v_dwe * v_wcc)  # total (discounted and cycle corrected) QALYs per individual

```

# 06 Run Microsimulation

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE }
# Your turn
outcomes_SoC  <- MicroSim(n_i = n_i, df_X = df_X, seed = 1, cycle_length = cycle_length, Diag = "SoC")  # Run for Standard of Care
outcomes_diagAB <- MicroSim(n_i = n_i, df_X = df_X, seed = 1, cycle_length = cycle_length, Diag = "AB") # Run simulation for strategy AB
```

# 07 Visualize results

```{r}
# Standard of Care
plot(density(outcomes_SoC$tc), main = paste("Total cost per person"),  xlab = "Cost ($)")
plot(density(outcomes_SoC$te), main = paste("Total QALYs per person"), xlab = "QALYs")
plot_trace_microsim(outcomes_SoC$m_M)      # health state trace
```

The first plot represents the distribution of total costs per person. The cost distribution is right-skewed, indicating that while most individuals accumulate costs in the $150,000â€“$250,000 range, some cases incur significantly higher costs. The peak appears between $175,000 and $225,000, suggesting this is the most common cost burden.

The second plot illustrates the distribution of total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per individual. There is a strong peak around 500 QALYs, suggesting that most individuals maintain a relatively high quality of life and long survival. The right-skewed shape indicates that a few individuals achieve even higher QALYs, while others accumulate fewer due to illness or death.

The third graph tracks the proportion of individuals in each health state over 30 cycles. Initially, most individuals start in the Healthy (H) state, but over time, more transition into the Sick (S) and Dead (D) states. The Sick state increases rapidly in the first few cycles before stabilizing and declining. Meanwhile, the proportion of deceased individuals (D) gradually rises. The total proportion correctly sums to 1 at each cycle.

```{r}
# Strategy AB
# Treatment AB
plot(density(outcomes_diagAB$tc), main = paste("Total cost per person"),  xlab = "Cost ($)")
plot(density(outcomes_diagAB$te), main = paste("Total QALYs per person"), xlab = "QALYs")
plot_trace_microsim(outcomes_diagAB$m_M)     # health state trace

```

The first plot represents the distribution of total costs per person. The distribution is right-skewed, with most costs accumulating in the range of $200,000 to $400,000, and a peak around $300,000. Some individuals experience significantly higher costs, but the frequency decreases beyond $450,000.

The second plot illustrates the distribution of total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per individual. There is a strong peak around 500 QALYs, suggesting that most individuals experience relatively high quality of life and longevity. A small proportion of the population accumulates lower QALYs, indicating some early deaths or long-term health issues, but the distribution remains heavily right-skewed.

The third plot tracks the proportion of individuals in each health state over 30 cycles. Initially, most individuals start in the Healthy (H) state (black line). Over time:

The proportion of Sick (S) individuals (red line) increases rapidly in the first few cycles before stabilizing and eventually declining.
The proportion of deceased individuals (D) (green line) gradually rises, overtaking the Sick population in later cycles.
The Healthy population continuously declines as more individuals transition into Sick or Dead.

# 08 Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)

```{r}
# store the mean costs of each strategy in a new variable C (vector of costs)
v_C <- c(outcomes_SoC$tc_hat, outcomes_diagAB$tc_hat)
# store the mean QALYs of each strategy in a new variable E (vector of effects)
v_E <- c(outcomes_SoC$te_hat, outcomes_diagAB$te_hat)

# use dampack to calculate the ICER
df_cea <- calculate_icers(cost       = v_C,
                          effect     = v_E,
                          strategies = v_names_str)
df_cea

## CEA table in proper format 
table_cea <- format_table_cea(df_cea) 
table_cea

```

Affordability: The decision to adopt Strategy AB depends on whether the ICER is below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. If the WTP threshold is higher than $4,694.37, then Strategy AB is cost-effective.

Cost-effectiveness decision:
If the WTP threshold is much higher than $4,694, Strategy AB should be adopted.
If the WTP is lower, it may not be cost-effective despite the higher QALYs.
Neither strategy is strictly worse, since they are not dominated. 

```{r}
## CEA frontier 
plot(df_cea, label = "all", txtsize = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.3))
```

Strategy AB improves health outcomes but at a higher cost.
The efficient frontier confirms that both strategies are viable choices.
Its cost-effectiveness depends on the WTP threshold.
