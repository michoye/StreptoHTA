# Is Throat Culture More Cost-Effective than Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Testing (RADT) for Diagnosisng Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in Pedriatric Sore Throat Patients?

# Background and Objectives

## Study Question

The study evaluates whether **Throat Culture** is more cost-effective than **Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Testing (RADT)** for diagnosing **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)** in pediatric sore throat patients.

### Relevance

-   Throat infections are often viral, yet **antibiotics are frequently over-prescribed**, contributing to antibiotic resistance.
-   Overuse of antibiotics presents **unnecessary health risks**.
-   **Optimizing decision-making** can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
-   The study's insights will support **healthcare policymakers and clinicians** in identifying the most **economically and clinically efficient** diagnostic and treatment strategies.

# Existing Decision Models

Several existing models evaluate diagnostic strategies using **rapid strep tests** and analyze the **cost-effectiveness of treatment options**.

Examples include:

-   **Sensitivity/specificity models** for **GAS testing**
-   **Cost-effectiveness studies** on delaying antibiotics for **watchful waiting**
-   Example: ["Management of Sore Throats in Children â€“ A Cost-effectiveness Analysis"](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/347278)

# Study Population

### Base Case Population:

-   **Children aged 5-15 years** presenting with throat infections.
-   Higher risk groups for **bacterial infections**.

### Socioeconomic and Clinical Characteristics:

-   **Socioeconomic variations** in access to **rapid diagnostic testing**.
-   **Common symptoms** include:
    -   Sore throat
    -   Fever
    -   Swollen lymph nodes
    -   Tonsillar exudate

# Setting and Location

The study applies to:

-   **Primary care clinics (General Practitioners)**
-   **Emergency departments**
-   **Regions with and without access to rapid strep tests**
-   **Settings relying on clinical diagnosis**

# Study Perspective

The decision model is based on the **healthcare payer perspective**, focusing on **direct medical costs**:

### Diagnostic Costs:

-   **Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Test (RADT)**
-   **Throat Culture (Lab processing, personnel time)**

### Treatment Costs:

-   **Antibiotics (Penicillin, other first-line treatments for GAS)**
-   **Costs related to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for false positives**

# Comparators

The study compares:

-   **Throat Culture** vs. **RADT** for diagnosing GAS in **primary care**.
-   If **test-positive**, antibiotics are **immediately prescribed**.

# Remaining Sections for Future Consideration

These aspects will be addressed in later stages of the study:

-   **Model type and structure**
-   **Health states and pathways**
-   **Time horizon for cost and outcome evaluation**
-   **Discount rates**
-   **Health outcome measures (e.g., QALYs, LYs)**
-   **Effectiveness data sources**
-   **Uncertainty characterization**
-   **Key assumptions**
-   **Stakeholder involvement**
